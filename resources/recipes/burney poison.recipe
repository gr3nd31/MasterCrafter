Description: A viscous, dangerous-looking concoction. This can be used to poison food and drink, or rubbed into a weapon. Creatures exposed to this poison must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC=17) or succumb to its effects, taking half damage (where applicable) and no other effect on a successful save. If used to augment a weapon, the next 3 attacks made with the weapon apply the effect(s) below. If ingested, the poison lasts for 4 minutes or 5 hours (DM's discretion).
   - Damage that the creature would take from sources that deal fire damage is increased by 3.
